    #The value can be one of:

    #where 'undef' is only used for 'is_tls_server=false' and
    #the other modes are as follows:
    #    1. 'old' (Mozilla Old) - is for SSL v3
    #    2. 'int' (Mozilla Intermediate) - is for TLS v1,
    #    3. 'mod' (Mozilla Modern) - is for TLS v1.2

    #    Mozilla Old suggests 512 as the minimum size to use
    #    Mozilla Intermediate suggests 1024 as the minimum size to use
