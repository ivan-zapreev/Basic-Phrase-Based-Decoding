  echo "      1. if <language> == \"auto\":"
  echo "        1.1. True: if language detection is enabled"
  echo "           1.1.1. True: detect a language:"
  echo "              1.1.1.1. Detected: remember the source language"
  echo "              1.1.1.2. Failed: report an error to the standard output and finish"
  echo "           1.1.2. False: report an error to the standard output and finish"
  echo "        1.2. False: nothing"
  echo "      2. Check if the language pre-processor is available"
  echo "        2.1. Available: call the language pre-processor"
  echo "           2.1. Success: output the language string to the standard output"
  echo "           2.1. Fail: report an error to the standard output and finish"
  echo "        2.1. Not available: check if the default pre-processor is available"
  echo "           2.1.1. Available: call the default pre-processor"
  echo "              2.1.1.1. Success: output the language string to the standard output"
  echo "              2.1.1.2. Fail: report an error to the standard output and finish"
  echo "           2.1.2. Not available: report an error to the standard output and finish"
  echo "   Pre-processing might include, but is not limited by: "
  echo "      * language detection - detecting the language in which the text is written"
  echo "      * tokenization - splitting the language words and punctuation marks with spaces"
  echo "      * lowercasing  - turning the text into the lowercase"
  echo "      * unification  - unifying the text by substituting longer utf-8 symbols with shorter ones"
  echo "   In addition to mentioned above, the result of this script must be two fold:"
  echo "      * If the pre-processing went without errors:"
  echo "         - The exit code must be 0"
  echo "         - The only data written to standard output must be the <language>"
  echo "         - The pre-processed text must be written into the file:"
  echo "              <work-dir>/<job-uid>.pre.out.txt"
  echo "      * If the pre-processing failed:"
  echo "         - The exit code must be 1"
  echo "         - The only data written to standard output must be the error message, max 1023 characters long"
  echo "------"
  echo "NOTES:"
  echo "------"
  echo "   * The bpbd-processor application after consuming the file:"
  echo "              <work-dir>/<job-uid>.pre.out.txt"
  echo "     will attempt to delete both pre-processing job files:"
  echo "              <work-dir>/<job-uid>.pre.in.txt"
  echo "              <work-dir>/<job-uid>.pre.out.txt"
  echo "     So, if these files are to be kept for, e.g. post-processing,"
  echo "     it is the responsibility of the script to do so."
  echo "   * This is a dummy script that only emulates the real behavior, therefore:"
  echo "      * The script only detects the input language to be \"German\""
  echo "      * The script only copies the input file into the output"
