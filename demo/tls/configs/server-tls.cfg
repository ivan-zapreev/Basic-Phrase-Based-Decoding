    #The value can be one of:

    #the other modes are as follows:
    #    1. 'old' (Mozilla Old) - is for SSL v3 or higher
    #    2. 'int' (Mozilla Intermediate) - is for TLS v1 or higher

    #                  smaller size will cause TLS handshake failure!
    #    Mozilla Intermediate - suggests 2048 as the minimum size to use
